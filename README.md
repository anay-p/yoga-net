# YogaNet

This is a model for classification of yoga poses using human activity recognition (HAR). The goal is to train a robust model that can accurately classify the yoga pose being performed in a video feed in real time. Libraries used are [MediaPipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). I am currently still working on this project.
